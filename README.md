# affe-mit-waffe-ERC721
This repository will be used to build the code for the Affe mit Waffe genesis ERC-721 collection. Initially the collection was deployed in the generic 1155 OpenSea Storefront contract. For various reasons it made sense to migrate the Affen to their own exclusive smart contract, which will be coded in this repository.
