/**
 * @notice Implementation of ERC-721 NFT lending. The code below was written by using, as a
 *   starting point, the code made public by the Meta Angels NFT team (thank you to that team
 *   for making their code available for other projects to use!)
 *   The code has been modified in several ways, most importantly, that in the original
 *   implementation it was included in the main contract, whereas here we have abstracted the
 *   functionality into its own parent contract. Also, some additional events have been added,
 *   and checking whether loans are paused has been moved to a Modifier. In addition a function
 *   has been added to allow a borrower to initiate the return of a loan (rather than only 
 *   allowing for the original lender to 'recall' the loan.)
 *   Note that when lending, the meaning of terms like 'owner' become ambiguous, particularly
 *   because once a token is lent, as far as the ERC721 standard is concerned, the borrower is
 *   technically the owner. (In other words, the function 'ownerOf()' reqired by EIP-721 will
 *   return the address of the borrower while a token is lent. In the comments and variable names
 *   below we have tried to disambiguate by refering wherever possible to the original/rightful
 *   owner as the address that truly owns the NFT (the address that is able to recall the loan
 *   whenever they want.) However it is important to understand that once a token is loaned, to
 *   the outside world it will appear to be 'owned' by the borrower. From that perspective, the
 *   'owner' is the current borrower.
 * @dev if you would like to use this code and add a function that enumerates the tokens
 *   loaned out by a particular address (eg. it could be a function called
 *   loanedTokensByAddress(address rightfulOwner) ), you'll need to modify this contract so it
 *   inherits from ERC721Enumerable (because such a function will need access to the
 *   'totalSupply()' provided by the Enumerable contract. For the sake of simplicity, this
 *   contract does not currently implement a function that generates the enumeration of loaned
 *   tokens. However, note that a child contract can readily implement such a function, if it
 *   inherits from ERC721Enumerable.
