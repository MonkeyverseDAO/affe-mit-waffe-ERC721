 *   development. The colors were decided by our AI – the Real Vision Bot. It determines
 *   the colors based on emotions obtained via natural language processing from the Real
 *   Vision interviews. Human creativity completes the piece for the finishing touch. Each
 *   Affe wants to connect, contrast, and stand out. Like the different colors and emotions
 *   of the day, the Affen are born to connect people, minds and ideas, countries, racesand
 *   genders through comparison and contrast.Despite their bossy appearance they are a
 *   happy hungry bunch at heart. They may look tough on the outside but are soft on the
 *   inside – and are easy to win over with a few bananas. The raised gun symbolizes our
 *   own strength and talents; it shall motivate us to use them wisely to overcome our
 *   differences for tolerance and resolve our conflicts peacefully.
