/**
 * @title Implementation ERC2981 Ethereum NFT Royalty Standard
 * @notice Implementation of the NFT Royalty Standard, a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information.
 *   Implementation based off of OpenZeppelin's ERC2981.sol, with some customization by Real Vision's web3
 *   team. (The customization primarily revolves around simplifying the contract so that royalties are only
 *   set for all tokens in the collection, rather than allowing for specific tokens to have custom royalties.)
 *   Our sincere Affen gratitude to the hard work, and collaborative spirit of both OpenZeppelin and Real Vision.
 *   IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See
 *   https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are
 *   expected to voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet
 *   widely supported.
 * @dev The 'Global' word in the name of this contract is there to signify that this contract deliberately does
 *   not implement royalties at the level of each token - it only allows for royalty destination and amount to
 *   be set for ALL tokens in the collection. ALSO NOTE that this contract is IERC2981, and yet, it does not
 *   implement the only function that is required by IERC2981: royaltyInfo(). This task is left to the descendants
 *   of this contract to implement.
